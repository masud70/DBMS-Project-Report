\begin{abstract}
This project report is mainly focused on the online payment and attendance system of the University of Chittagong. In the university, numerous students pay all the university fees through bank drafts to the university's accounts in a specific bank branch which doesn't facilitate online systems. This analog payment system is not efficient enough especially during periods of examinations when most of the students are to pay examination fees. This process is characterized by long queues, too much waiting by the students, and congestion at banks where payments are made. On the other hand, manually attendance-taking still exists here which is excessively time-consuming. It was upon such background that we embarked on the project to develop an alternative system that enables online payment \& attendance by students and their sponsors. Using this system every student will be comfortable with the online payment procedures. Also, it will save a lot of time by taking attendance online. The system was implemented using a JavaScript-based framework named ``React" including Cascading Style Sheets for frontend and ``ExpressJs" for backend, Apache web server, MySQL database server. System testing and validation were also done by allowing users of the system to interact with it using test data. Currently, the system is only limited to the payment and attendance system. In the future, this system can be expanded with various online systems like No Objection Certificate (NOC), Student Management System, Employee Management System, and so on. The result of the project is an online payment and attendance system for the University of Chittagong that provides relief of the long endured problems of the current modes of payment at the university as well as a time-consuming manual attendance system.\\ \\
