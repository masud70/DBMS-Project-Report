The University of Chittagong's online payment and attendance system is the focus of this project report, which is primarily concerned with that system. A large number of students at the university pay all of the university fees using bank drafts to the institution's accounts at a particular bank branch that does not allow for the use of internet payment methods. This analog payment mechanism is inefficient, particularly during examination seasons, when the majority of students are required to pay examination fees. It is marked by lengthy lines, excessive waiting on the part of students, and congestion at the banks where payments are made throughout this procedure. Alternatively, manually recording attendance continues to be practiced here, and it is quite time-consuming to do so. It was against this backdrop that we began work on the project to establish an alternate payment and attendance system that would allow students and their sponsors to pay and show up for class online. This method ensures that all students are acquainted with the online payment processes. Using this technology, Additionally, taking attendance online will save a significant amount of time. The system was developed using a JavaScript-based framework termed "React," which included Cascading Style Sheets for the frontend and "ExpressJs" for the backend, as well as an Apache web server and a MySQL database server, among other technologies. Testing and validation of the system were also carried out by enabling users of the system to engage with it while interacting with test data. For the time being, the system is solely capable of handling the payment and attendance systems. This system has the potential to be developed in the future to include numerous online systems such as the No Objection Certificate (NOC), the Student Management System, the Employee Management System, and so on. The project's outcome is an online payment and attendance system for the University of Chittagong, which alleviates the long-standing challenges associated with the university's present ways of payment as well as the time-consuming manual attendance method.\\ \\
