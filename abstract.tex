\begin{abstract}
The University of Chittagong's online payment and attendance system is the objective of this project report. A large number of students at the university pay all university fees using bank drafts to the institution's accounts at a particular bank branch that does not allow for the use of internet payment methods. This analog payment mechanism is inefficient, particularly during examination seasons, when the majority of students are required to pay examination fees. It is marked by lengthy lines, excessive waiting on the part of students, and congestion at the banks where payments are made throughout this procedure. On the other hand, manually documenting attendance, is still performed here, and it takes a long time. Against this backdrop, we began work on a project to create an alternative payment and attendance system that would allow students to pay and show up for class online. This method ensures that all students are acquainted with the online payment processes. Additionally, taking attendance online will save a significant amount of time. To maintain the system development process, we used the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the Scrum method to help team members work together. The system was developed using a JavaScript-based framework termed "React," which included Cascading Style Sheets for the frontend and "ExpressJs" for the backend, as well as an Apache web server and a MySQL database server, among other technologies. Testing and validation of the system were also carried out by enabling users to engage with it while interacting with test data. For the time being, the system is solely capable of handling the payment and attendance systems. Our system can develop this system in the future to include numerous online systems such as the No Objection Certificate (NOC), the Student Management System, the Employee Management System, and so on. The project's outcome is an online payment and attendance system for the University of Chittagong, which alleviates the long-standing challenges associated with the university's present ways of payment and the time-consuming manual attendance method.\\ \\
